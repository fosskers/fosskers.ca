I recently received Tolkien's /Unfinished Tales/ as a birthday gift, and within
the second of the "Great Tales", the /Narn i Hîn Húrin/ (Eng.: The Tale of the
Children of Húrin) we hear of Nellas the elf-maiden of Doriath. Although
unmentioned in the published /Silmarillion/, Nellas spent much time with Húrin's
son Túrin during his fosterhood in Doriath. Mention of Nellas is brief but
important to Túrin's absolvement of his "crime" against the elf Saeros, who died
in a tragic fall.

The glossary gives the following description of Nellas:

#+begin_quote
Elf of Doriath, friend of Túrin in his boyhood; bore witness against Saeros in
the trial of Túrin before Thingol.
#+end_quote

This only. Yet this does not tell their full story, and I am compelled to quote
all mentions of her here to imply my first impression; that Nellas loved Túrin
but he never knew, and this was a grief that she bore in silence.

* Túrin in Doriath

By a hard road in exile from his homeland of Dorlómin comes Túrin to Doriath,
the forest kingdom of the Gray Elves.

#+begin_quote
In the years of his childhood in the kingdom of Doriath Túrin was watched over
by Melian, though he saw her seldom. But there was a maiden named Nellas, who
lived in the woods; and at Melian's bidding she would follow Túrin if he strayed
in the forest, and often she met him there, as it were by chance. From Nellas
Túrin learned much concerning the ways and the wild things of Doriath, and she
taught him to speak the Sindarin tongue after the manner of the ancient realm,
older, and more courteous, and richer in beautiful words.

An editorial note by Christopher Tolkien goes on here to say:

#+begin_quote
Elsewhere my father remarked that the speech of Doriath, whether of the King or
others, was even in the days of Túrin more antique than that used elsewhere; and
also that Mîm observed that one thing of which Túrin never rid himself, despite
his grievance against Doriath, was the speech he had acquired during his
fostering.
#+end_quote

The original text continues.

#+begin_quote
Thus for a little while his mood was lightened, until he fell again under
shadow, and that friendship passed like a morning of spring. For Nellas did not
go to Menegroth, and was unwilling ever to walk under roofs of stone; so that as
Túrin's boyhood passed and he turned his thoughts to the deeds of men, he saw
her less and less often, and at last called for her no more. But she watched
over him still, though now she remained hidden.

* Thingol Pronounces Túrin's Doom

Túrin, now a man, has laboured much in battles against the Orcs along the
northern borders of Doriath. An envious and malicious elf named Saeros makes an
attempt on Túrin's life, but ends up dead himself. Túrin flees and
misunderstanding grows among the elves, and as Thingol the king is about to
announce Túrin's banishment, there is a revelation.

#+begin_quote
Then there was silence in the hall, and Thingol lifted up his hand to pronounce
his doom. But at that moment Beleg entered in haste, and cried: "Lord, may I yet
speak?"

"You come late," said Thingol. "Were you not bidden with the others?"

"Truly, lord," answered Beleg, "but I was delayed; I sought for one whom I knew.
Now I bring at last a witness who should be heard, ere your doom falls."

"All were summoned who had aught to tell," said the King. "What can he tell me
now of more weight than those to whom I have listened?"

"You shall judge when you have heard," said Beleg. "Grant this to me, if I have
ever deserved your grace."

"To you I grant it," said Thingol. Then Beleg went out, and led in by the hand
the maiden Nellas, who dwelt in the woods, and came never into Menegroth; and
she was afraid, both for the great pillared hall and the roof of stone, and for
the company of many eyes that watched her. And when Thingol bade her speak, she
said: "Lord, I was sitting in a tree"; but then she faltered in awe of the King,
and could say no more.

At that the King smiled, and said: "Others have done this also, but have felt no
need to tell me of it."

"Others indeed", said she, taking courage from his smile. "Even Lúthien! And of
her I was thinking that morning, and of Beren the Man."
#+end_quote

She was watching Túrin from afar, as always, thinking of Beren and Lúthien, the
first union of Men and Elves.

#+begin_quote
To that Thingol said nothing, and he smiled no longer, but waited until Nellas
should speak again.

"For Túrin reminded me of Beren," she said at last. "They are akin, I am told,
and their kinship can be seen by some: by some that look close."

Then Thingol grew impatient. "That may be," he said. "But Túrin son of Húrin is
gone in scorn of me, and you will see him no more to read his kindred. For now I
will speak my judgement."

"Lord King!" she cried then. "Bear with me, and let me speak first. I sat in a
tree to look on Túrin as he went away; and I saw Saeros come out from the wood
with sword and shield, and spring on Túrin unawares."

At that there was a murmur in the hall; and the King lifted his hand, saying:
"You bring graver news to my ear than seemed likely. Take heed now to all that
you say; for this is a court of doom."

"So Beleg has told me," she answered, "and only for that have I dared to come
here, so that Túrin shall not be ill judged. He is valiant, but he is merciful.
They fought, lord, these two, until Túrin had bereft Saeros of both shield and
sword; but he did not slay him. Therefore I do not believe that he willed his
death in the end. If Saeros were put to shame, it was shame that he had earned."
#+end_quote

Thingol goes on to find Túrin thus innocent, and that he should be called back
to Doriath.

#+begin_quote
But when the doom was pronounced, suddenly Nellas wept. "Where can he be found?"
she said. "He has left our land, and the world is wide."
#+end_quote

She knew he had left, because she must have followed him as far as her courage
would allow, perhaps to the borders of Doriath itself.

* Beleg and Túrin Reunite in the Wild

Many search for Túrin, but only Beleg remains true to the task. Eventually Túrin
is found, and Beleg tells him all that has happened.

#+begin_quote
Then Túrin sat in silence, and strove with his pride, which would not let him
turn back; and he brooded on the years that lay behind him. But coming suddenly
out of his thought he said to Beleg: "The elf-maiden whom you named: I owe her
well for her timely witness; yet I cannot recall her. Why did she watch my
ways?"

Then Beleg looked strangley at him. "Why indeed?" he said. "Túrin, have you
lived always with your heart and half your mind far away? You walked with Nellas
in the woods of Doriath, when you were a boy."
#+end_quote

Elves have a long memory. Beleg knew the relationship Nellas had with Túrin, and
from the above quotes it seems he knew her personally as well. It isn't hard to
believe that she watched over Túrin for many years and that while Túrin might
not have noticed, Beleg certainly had. Beleg knew she would have witnessed the
fight.

#+begin_quote
"That was long ago," said Túrin. "Or so my childhood now seems, and a mist is
over it - save only the memory of my father's house in Dor-lómin. But why should
I have walked with an elf-maiden?"
#+end_quote

A man with his mind on other things. Far things that Nellas could have no part
of. Why does he retain no memory of her at all?

#+begin_quote
"To learn what she could teach, maybe," said Beleg. "Alas, child of Men! There
are other griefs in Middle-earth than yours, and wounds made by no weapon.
Indeed, I begin to think that Elves and Men should not meet or meddle."
#+end_quote

It is clear what he means by "meet or meddle". Beleg believes only tragedy can
come of it, as the "loss" of Lúthien would seem to an Elf of Doriath like
himself.

#+begin_quote
Túrin said nothing, but looked long in Beleg's face, as if he would read in it
the riddle of his words. But Nellas of Doriath never saw him again, and his
shadow passed from her.
#+end_quote

The final line struck me the most. This could mean either "the curse of Morgoth
that follows Húrin's kin" or "the weight of unrequited love". My first reading
was the latter meaning. Then, perhaps that her feelings could even pass away at
all is proof that he was not Beren, she was not Lúthien, and their love was not
a destined thing. It is good that she was one day free of that weight, but
surely bitter in the passing nonetheless.

Nellas isn't mentioned again, but she remains within Túrin as the one who gave
him a new voice:

#+begin_quote
The sun shone and the young leaves were green; and Túrin was irked by the
squalid camp of the outlaws, and he wandered away alone far into the forest.
Against his will he remembered the Hidden Kingdom, and he seemed to hear the
names of the flowers of Doriath as echoes of an old tongue almost forgotten.
#+end_quote
