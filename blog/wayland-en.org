#+CATEGORY: tech

This article is a guide for achieving a full-as-possible [[https://wayland.freedesktop.org/][Wayland]] setup on Arch
Linux. If you follow the entire guide, by the end you will have:

- [[https://swaywm.org/][Sway]], a tiling window manager.
- [[https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar][Waybar]], a topbar very similar to [[https://github.com/polybar/polybar][Polybar]].
- [[https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi][Wofi]], a pure GTK (and thus Wayland) customizable application launcher.
- [[https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty][Alacritty]], a modern terminal that "just works".
- Firefox and/or Chromium in Wayland with working screen sharing.
- Emacs running fully in Wayland via brand-new pure GTK internals.
- /Most/ QT applications running in Wayland.
- Steam games set up to consider Wayland, if they can.
- (Optional) Japanese input via [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fcitx5][Fcitx5]].

You will also learn how to confirm if an app is running in Wayland or not, and
will become aware of ~XWayland~ and major programs that still need it to run
properly. While this guide was written with Arch Linux in mind, it should be
adaptable to any brand of Linux that you run. Enjoy, and good luck!

*Note:* You may wish to open this guide on a phone or second computer before
continuing, as we will need to restart your window manager several times
throughout.

* Foreword: Wayland? XWayland?

Wayland is the next generation Display Protocol for Linux. You've probably heard
of "X" (or "X11" or "XOrg"), but you may not have known of its issues: age,
performance, security, and dev-friendliness. Even Adam Jackson, the long-time
release manager of X [[https://ajaxnwnk.blogspot.com/2020/10/on-abandoning-x-server.html][calls for the adoption of Wayland]]. That said, X is
well-established and the transition won't happen over night. Many core apps on a
Linux system are bound tightly to its ecosystem:

#+begin_example
> pacman -Qg xorg | wc -l
38
#+end_example

But you might be surprised to learn that you almost certainly have ~wayland~
installed already.

#+begin_example
> pacman -Qi wayland
Name            : wayland
Version         : 1.19.0-1
Description     : A computer display server protocol
Architecture    : x86_64
URL             : https://wayland.freedesktop.org/
Licenses        : MIT
# ... etc.
#+end_example

Fortunately for us, the Linux ecosystem's transition to Wayland has been
[[https://arewewaylandyet.com/][marching steadily forward]] through the years. The major GUI frameworks like GTK
and QT fully support it. [[https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/01/ubuntu-21-04-will-use-wayland-by-default][Ubuntu 21.04 will run with Wayland by default]]. But no
need to wait for major distros to move: we can jump to Wayland today.

You should know that there are some major applications that don't (or won't [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/issues/38][or
can't]]) support Wayland. Programs like this can still be run in a Wayland
environment through an isolated X instance called *XWayland*. This means that
the transition to Wayland can be gradual: you won't lose access to older
programs that you still need.

One last piece of good news before we move on: in Wayland, you don't need a
compositor program like [[https://github.com/yshui/picom][picom]] or [[http://www.compiz.org/][compiz]] that's separate from your window
manager. Translation? Fewer moving parts, less configuration to manage, and
terminal transparency just works!

* Prerequisites

** Packages

On Arch Linux, run the following command to install everything you'll need for
the main section of the guide and general Wayland compatibility:

#+begin_example
sudo pacman -S \
  sway alacritty waybar wofi \
  xorg-xwayland xorg-xlsclients qt5-wayland glfw-wayland
#+end_example

~qt5-wayland~ and ~glfw-wayland~ provide Wayland API compatibility for QT5 and
[[https://www.glfw.org/][GLFW]] respectively. ~xlsclients~ is explained below.

** Detecting XWayland with ~xlsclients~

To get a list of all windows currently running through XWayland, use ~xlsclients~:

#+begin_example
> xlsclients
archlinux  discord
archlinux  steam
#+end_example

This way, you can quickly test your Wayland config with various applications.

* Sway

Sway is a tiling window manager and a drop-in replacement for [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]]. Like its
inspiration it too is written in C, and thus is very fast and has little
resource overhead. Although Sway can read i3 config as-is (i.e. your
~/home/you/.config/i3/config~), I recommend starting with a blank slate and then
copying over specific bindings as you need them.

First, copy Sway's config template:

#+begin_example
cd ~/.config
mkdir sway
cd sway
cp /etc/sway/config .
#+end_example

Now exit whatever desktop environment / window manager you're in, and drop down
to your basic login terminal. From here, run ~sway~ and Sway should start.
Congratulations, you're running Wayland!

Well let's not celebrate too early. You might be used to having lines like ~exec
i3~ in a ~.xinitrc~, then starting X with ~startx~. No longer! From here,
everything happens in our Sway config. Speaking of which, here are some
highlights below.

** Sway Config and Extras

[[https://github.com/fosskers/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/sway/config][Here is my full Sway configuration]]. Otherwise, Sway is primarily documented in
its man pages. When in doubt, check them first. If that fails, you can also
consult the [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki][Sway Wiki]].

Here are some useful bindings that you'll need right away, but are free to
change later:

- Reload Sway: ~Super+Shift+c~ (won't close your running programs)
- Exit Sway: ~Super+Shift+e~
- Open a Terminal: ~Super+Return~
- Open a Program: ~Super+d~

*Monitor Setup*

I have two monitors: my laptop to my left, and my proper monitor directly in
front of me. Getting my mouse to move naturally across the monitor boundary requires
the following:

#+begin_example
output eDP-1 mode 2560x1440 position 0,0 scale 2
output HDMI-A-2 mode 1920x1080 position 1280,0
#+end_example

There is some math involved in determining the proper offset to use for the
second monitor (the ~1280~ in the second line). See ~man sway-output~ for more
information. You can use ~swaymsg -t get_outputs~ to view the official names and
available resolutions of all your monitors.

*Gaps*

[[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][i3-gaps]] is a popular i3 variant that allows gaps between windows. Luckily this
functionality is already included in Sway, and can be activated by adding the
following somewhere in your Sway config:

#+begin_example
  # A 10-pixel border around every window.
  gaps inner 10

  # Removes the title bar of each window.
  default_border pixel 3
#+end_example

You will need to *exit* Sway once and rerun it from your login terminal for the
change to take effect.

*Random Wallpapers*

[[https://github.com/fosskers/rs-setwall][setwall]] can be used to set a random background image every time to boot Sway:

#+begin_example
exec_always setwall random ~/Pictures/backgrounds/ -c sway
#+end_example

** Alacritty

Alacritty is a great modern terminal emulator with sane defaults. It is also the
default for Sway when opening a new terminal with ~Super+Return~. I used ~urxvt~
for years, but upon switching to Alacritty recently a number of issues I had had
just went away.

The only thing I change about Alacritty's default config is the background
opacity. Within ~/home/you/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml~:

#+begin_src yaml
window:
  opacity: 0.8
#+end_src

Voilà, transparent terminals!

** Waybar

The default bar for Sway is pretty good, but Waybar unlocks a lot more
customisability. It also "just works" on multiple monitors, unlike Polybar which
requires custom scripting.

To use Waybar instead of the default bar, comment out the ~bar~ section near the
end of your Sway config, and in its place add this:

#+begin_example
  bar {
      swaybar_command waybar
  }
#+end_example

[[https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Examples][The Waybar Wiki]] has plenty of example configurations, and [[https://github.com/fosskers/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/waybar/config][here is my own]] along
with [[https://github.com/fosskers/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/waybar/style.css][its custom CSS styling]]. The bar itself is transparent, with the top-right
widgets and tray looking like this:

[[/assets/images/waybar-top-right.png]]

After tweaking your Waybar config, its enough to refresh Sway via
~Super+Shift+c~ as usual to refresh your Waybars as well.

** Wofi

By default Sway uses ~dmenu~ for opening programs, but surprisingly its UI runs
in XWayland. There are [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/i3-Migration-Guide][a number of alternatives]] available, and I chose [[https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi][Wofi]].

[[/assets/images/wofi.jpg]]

This is the [[https://github.com/fosskers/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/wofi/style.css][look I settled on]], but since it's all CSS you're [[https://cloudninja.pw/docs/wofi.html][free to experiment]]!
Note that you'll need the following in your Sway config:

#+begin_example
  set $menu wofi --show=drun --lines=5 --prompt=""
#+end_example

There are a few different prompt modes. ~drun~ only matches and displays hits
for programs that have "Desktop" entries somewhere on your machine, as opposed
to everything on your PATH. In fact, not doing so can have performance problems
and is [[https://todo.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/35][a known issue]].

* Major Applications

Most applications, if running on GTK or QT, have automatic Wayland support and
require no further configuration. Some specific programs need tweaks, which
we'll address below.

A number of current resources claim you need GTK and QT-specific environment
variables set in order for them to use Wayland, but *I found this not to be
true*.

** Firefox

The ~about:support~ page in Firefox has a field titled /Window Protocol/ that
tells us which protocol it is running through. If still on X11, this field will
say ~x11~. If through Sway without the tweak below, you should see ~xwayland~. A
quick test with ~xlsclients~ should also reveal that Firefox isn't yet running
natively through Wayland. Let's fix that.

Set the ~MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND~ environment variable to ~1~. I place the following
in my Fish config (users of other shells will need something similar):

#+begin_example
  set -x MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND 1
#+end_example

*Exit Sway and log out entirely once.* Once logged back in and with Sway
reopened, this variable change should have propagated to everywhere that
matters. Now if you open Firefox again through Wofi and check ~about:support~,
you should find:

[[/assets/images/firefox-wayland.png]]

** Chromium

Chromium's conversion is a bit simpler. In
~/home/you/.config/chromium-flags.conf~, add the following lines:

#+begin_example
--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform
--ozone-platform=wayland
#+end_example

Restart Chromium, and that should be it. You can confirm with ~xlsclients~.

** Emacs

Yes, Emacs can be ran purely in Wayland. Some of you might be saying:

#+begin_quote
But Emacs isn't a true GTK app!
#+end_quote

And yes, that used to be true. [[https://lwn.net/Articles/843896/][As of early 2021]], Emacs can be built with "pure
GTK" internals, making it entirely Wayland compatible. This feature will be
available in Emacs 28 (yet unreleased as of this writing), but luckily [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin/][there is
an AUR package]] that tracks the Wayland development branch and ships a prebuilt
binary. We can install it with a tool like [[https://github.com/fosskers/aura][Aura]]:

#+begin_example
  sudo aura -Axa emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin
#+end_example

Note that this package ~Provides: emacs~, so it will take the place of any other
Emacs package you have installed.

If you're willing to build the =master= branch and thereby get early access to
Emacs 29, then you can set Emacs' background opacity with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 80)
#+end_src

to achieve native transparency.

** Steam and Gaming

[[https://www.protondb.com/][Proton games]] likes /Among Us/ work as-is, since they run in a highly tweaked
Wine/dependency environment that is known to work for each game. /Among Us/
reacts well to window resizing and relocation within Sway.

For native games like Half-life (old), Trine 2 (graphics heavy), and Tabletop
Simulator (modern toolchain) to work, I had to set the environment variable
~SDL_VIDEODRIVER~ to ~x11~. Otherwise they fail to start properly. From the Arch
Wiki:

#+begin_quote
Note: Many proprietary games come bundled with old versions of SDL, which do not
support Wayland and might break entirely if you set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland.
#+end_quote

Even Stellaris requires ~x11~ to work.

If you don't want to force all SDL usage to X11, you don't have to. Steam allows
us to set specific environment variables per game. To set this, right-click on a
game, and visit its ~Properties~. In ~GENERAL > LAUNCH OPTIONS~, enter the
following and your game should be runnable:

[[/assets/images/steam-sdl-override.png]]

So to reiterate, here is the environment variable I have set in Fish:

#+begin_example
  set -x SDL_VIDEODRIVER 'wayland'
#+end_example

And I override this to ~x11~ on a case-by-case basis within Steam.

** Signal

In early May of 2021, Signal released ~5.1.0~ which uses a Wayland-compatible
version of Electron. Unfortunately the Arch package ~signal-desktop~ doesn't yet
run in this mode by default, so manual activation is necessary. From the command
line:

#+begin_src bash
signal-desktop --use-tray-icon --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
#+end_src

Or if you run Signal via a launcher, we can edit the ~.desktop~ file provided by
the package to respect these options as well. Within
~/usr/share/applications/signal-desktop.desktop~, alter the ~Exec~ line to have the
following:

#+begin_example
Exec=signal-desktop --use-tray-icon --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland -- %u
#+end_example

A similar strategy would work for other Electron apps that use at least version 12.

* Other Settings

If the sections here aren't applicable to you, feel free to skip them.

** Keyboard Layouts

I use the Colemak layout when typing, so I have the following in my Sway config:

#+begin_example
  input * {
      xkb_layout "us"
      xkb_variant "colemak"
  }
#+end_example

Unfortunately there seems to be [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4664][a strange bug]] where the layout will suddenly
switch back to qwerty in certain windows. I noticed the following symptom: when
a terminal is opened, the left-most XWayland window will switch back to qwerty.
I found two ways around this:

- Use as many pure Wayland apps as possible, or;
- Install an IME (Input Method Editor), for instance for typing non-ASCII languages (see below).

** Japanese Input

Sway is very close to having first-class support for switching Input Methods
(see [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/4740#issuecomment-787578644][Sway#4740]], [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/5890][Sway#5890]], and [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/4932][Sway#4932]]). For now, here is a setup that works
through dbus allowing us to change Methods and type Japanese in all Wayland and
XWayland windows *except Alacritty*.

First, install these packages:

#+begin_example
  sudo pacman -S fcitx5 fcitx5-configtool \
    fcitx5-gtk fcitx5-mozc fcitx5-qt
#+end_example

Then add the following to ~/etc/environment~:

#+begin_example
  GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
  QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
  XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
#+end_example

And this to your Sway config:

#+begin_example
  exec_always fcitx5 -d --replace
#+end_example

*Now restart your computer.*

Hopefully you now see a keyboard icon in your Waybar tray. To configure
~fcitx5~, open ~fcitx5-configtool~. Here is my setup:

[[/assets/images/fcitx5.png]]

You'll see that I specifically set my English keyboard to Colemak, and added
~Mozc~ from the list on the right. Check the ~Global Options~ tab to set your
Method switching keybinding. After that, hit ~Apply~, and you should now be able
to switch Input Methods and type Japanese. If the keybinding doesn't work, you
can also switch Methods by clicking the icon in the Waybar tray.

** Screen Sharing

Screen sharing in Firefox and Chromium is possible through Pipewire and some
helper packages, although at the moment we can only share entire screens and
not individual windows. To proceed, first install the following packages:

#+begin_example
  sudo pacman -S xdg-desktop-portal-wlr libpipewire02
#+end_example

The latter is necessary only for Chromium. *Now restart your computer.*

Let's test Firefox first using Mozilla's [[https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html][gum test page]]. When the browser prompts
you for a window selection, choose /Use operating system settings/:

[[/assets/images/firefox-screen-select.jpg]]

You will notice your cursor change; ~xdg-desktop-portal-wlr~ is expecting you to
choose a display to share. Click one and screen sharing should begin.

For Chromium, we need to activate a feature flag to allow Chromium to talk to
Pipewire. First visit ~chrome://flags~, then find and enable the ~WebRTC
PipeWire support~ feature. That's it!

If you're having issues with either of these browsers, check the [[https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/wiki/FAQ][XDPW FAQ]].

* XWayland and Incompatibilities

Know of any other incompatibilities? [[https://github.com/fosskers/fosskers.ca][Please let me know]].

** Electron Apps

As of 2021 May, Signal and VSCode can now be ran in Wayland thanks to their
upgrading to Electron 12.

Other Electron apps like Discord and Slack instead must run in XWayland until
they can upgrade.

* Community Tips

** KWin Users

Thanks to *flying-sheep* for this tip:

#+begin_quote
For people using KWin: You can display a window helping you to identify XWayland
windows using:
#+end_quote

#+begin_example
qdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin org.kde.KWin.showDebugConsole
#+end_example

** Polkit

Thanks to Aaron Wiedemer for the following suggestion:

#+begin_quote
Some apps sometimes require priveleges, e.g. a software manager needs
permissions to start an update, but just searching for packages requires no
additional permissions. These apps then pop up a little box and ask for the
password. This requires a daemon which is not started by sway, so we need to
auto start one with our sway config.
#+end_quote

[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polkit][There are a number of options for Polkit clients.]] For instance, ~polkit-gnome~
has no dependencies and can be started in ~sway~ via:

#+begin_example
exec_always /usr/lib/polkit-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
#+end_example
