How to deploy a Haskell program?

You should use Docker only if you have a pre-existing container collection
to integrate into.

Otherwise, for the lay-Haskeller (myself included), I recommend Heroku for
deploying projects.

* The Simple Way: Heroku

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I just want to take a little server I wrote and throw it on the web somewhere.
#+END_QUOTE

Heroku is the free and convenient solution for this. It is a hosting service that
allows pushes to a Github
~master~ branch to trigger redeploys, and it also caches dependencies so that
subsequent redeploys are fast.

The cheapest tier of Heroku machines ("dynos") is free. These dynos sleep after
30 minutes of inactivity but reawaken quickly when called. Paid dynos don't sleep.

For some of what I describe
below there is also a ~heroku~ CLI tool, but I found it unnecessary. Also included
below are instructions for configuring a Namecheap domain to point to Heroku, so
our app can be /foobar.com/ instead of /foobar.herokuapp.com/.

** Listening on ~$PORT~

It is The Heroku Wayâ„¢ for applications to listen for incoming requests on ~$PORT~.
This can conflict with local development workflows, but we can get around that with
the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DeriveAnyClass #-}

  import qualified Network.Wai.Handler.Warp as W
  import           Options.Generic
  import           System.Environment (lookupEnv)
  import           Text.Read (readMaybe)

  data Args = Args { port :: Maybe Int
                     <?> "Port to listen for requests on, otherwise $PORT" }
    deriving (Generic, ParseRecord)

  app :: Application  -- Some `wai` Application

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    Args (Helpful p) <- getRecord "Backend server for foobar.com"
    herokuPort <- (>>= readMaybe) <$> lookupEnv "PORT"
    let prt = maybe 8080 id $ p <|> herokuPort
    putStrLn $ "Listening on port " <> show prt
    W.run prt app
#+END_SRC

Local server runs are then:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack exec -- server --port 8080
#+END_SRC

** Heroku Settings
*** Committing a ~Procfile~

We need only a ~Procfile~ commited to our repo. This defines what command Heroku should
run after it builds our project. Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
web: server
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where ~server~ is the name of the executable as defined in ~.cabal~. If the server
takes other arguments, the ~Procfile~ might look something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
web: server --js app.min.js
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Settings through Heroku UI

All other config happens right in Heroku. We'll need both a Heroku account and
a Github repo to link to.

First, we create a new Heroku project through the UI. Once active, we should see
the /Deploy/ tab:

[[/assets/images/heroku00.jpg]]

Ignoring the CLI instructions at the bottom, we choose Github as our deployment method,
and connect our repo in the resulting UI.

Next, head to the /Settings/ tab and find the /Buildpacks/ section:

[[/assets/images/heroku01.jpg]]

Buildpacks are script sets that Heroku uses to build projects of some language type.
Click the /Add buildpack/ button and enter the following URL:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
https://github.com/mfine/heroku-buildpack-stack
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will allow ~stack~-based projects to compile while also
caching built dependencies. Credits to Mark Fine, Joe Nelson et al.
for their work in this area.

** Deployment

~git push origin master~ should be all we need. We can also force builds on other
branches via the /Deploy/ tab.

** Connecting with Namecheap

Follow [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/31549804/643684][this StackOverflow post]] - it's what I used for this website.

*** HTTPS

Heroku handles HTTPS for paid dynos automatically via [[https://letsencrypt.org/][Let's Encrypt]]. For our Namecheap settings
to cooperate, we must change (within Namecheap's dashboard) the ~Value~ field
of each DNS record from:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yourappname.herokuapp.com
#+END_EXAMPLE

to (note the extension!):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yourdomain.com.herokudns.com
#+END_EXAMPLE

So for this site, I changed ~fosskers.herokuapp.com~ to ~fosskers.ca.herokudns.com~.
The changes will take time to propagate around the internet, but once they do you
should have ~https://yourdomain.com~ working without any extra configuration.

* The Container Way: ~stack~ and Docker

For a Haskell-only production environment, Docker is strictly unnecessary.
However, if our production system is already dockerized or our project managers
have succumb to marketing, ~stack~ can help us.

By adding something like the following to our ~stack.yaml~:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  image:
    containers:
      - base: "fpco/ubuntu-with-libgmp:14.04"
        name: "foobar-server"
        entrypoints:
          - foobar-server-exe
#+END_SRC

and running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack image container
#+END_SRC

our Docker image will build. We can then fit it in to our deployment system as necessary.
See [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#docker][the official Stack docs]] for detailed information.
