From 2024 April 16th to June 1st I walked 1265 kilometers around the island of
Shikoku in Japan. The route is called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage][Henro Pilgrimage]] and has existed in
evolving forms for perhaps 800 years. It is based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingon_Buddhism][Shingon Buddhism]] and
involves visiting 88 temples, offering rites and receiving various marks of
passage.

The route took me 47 days, the last of which I spent climbing Koyasan in
Wakayama to report my success to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%ABkai][Kūkai]], the monk who brought Shingon to Japan
from China in the 800s, and is said to be in a state of eternal meditation on
the mountaintop.

This article is a transcription and translation of my handwritten journal
entries.

* Tokushima Prefecture - The Beginning

** Day 0 - April 15

Apparently the Japanese word for "Leech" is "Hiru", which happens to overlap
with the word for "afternoon". I've already been to Temple 1, Ryōzenji, with
Takahara-san, an 80-year-old man that is staying at the same Henro House lodge
as me today. I've already bought all the gear I need except for a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasa_(hat)][Sugegasa]]. My
official start is supposed to be tomorrow, but the guy running the lodge
suggested we get the first temple out of the way today (just 100m up the road)
so that we can get on our way earlier tomorrow. We took his advice but it was
still so sudden that a large part of me was having trouble believing the journey
had really begun. Tonight I'm sharing a room with Takahara-san.

Post-trip Addendum:

[[https://henrohouse.jp/en][Henro House]] is an alliance of inns that cater to walking pilgrims and
smartphone-savvy folks from overseas. You can check availability and book
directly online. Average cost for one night is around 3500 yen. Sometimes they
feed you but not always.

I say "shared a room" but it was massive and probably could have slept 10
people.

Original Japanese:

「蛭」は Leech らしい。遍路ハウスで知り合った高原さん（８０歳）と一緒に霊山寺に
お詣りした。菅笠以外は全部購入済み。正式な出発は明日のはずだったが宿の人に今日の
内にした方が朝早く旅立てると言われてそうしたけれど、急で気持ちが追いつかなかった。
夜は高原さんと相部屋。

** Day 1 - April 16 (19km)

I couldn't sleep until past midnight. Nerves and other thoughts swam through my
head. I was worried that my [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D-zue][Kongō Staff]] wouldn't last the trip, but I see now
that it's pretty much the same as everyone else has.

Breakfast was offered as /Osettai/ by the Henro House. After setting off I headed
up to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Casahiko_Shrine][Ōasa-Hiko Jinja]] to ask protection from the nature gods (even though this
is a Buddhist pilgrimage). It was 7 a.m. but there was already an attendent
around. He was quite nice and sold me a charm unique to their Shrine made of
hemp. Setting off again, I cried for some reason. I felt like I had a lot of
support behind me and felt new determination.

Gokurakuji (2) was quite beautiful, and I couldn't shake the feeling I had been
to Kinsenji (3) already last year. At Dainichiji (4) I gave some candies to a
pair of older pilgrims. As I was taking a break, I met a guy named Jeffery from
Taiwan, but I was concerned that Takahara-san hadn't shown up yet. It was noon
by the time I arrived at Jizōji (5), so I bought a bentō from a lady selling
them in the parking lot. At Anrakuji (6) I ran into Jeffery again and we
discussed where we'd be sleeping for the night. I got us permission to stay in
the bell tower above the main gate from the temple staff. First though he'd head
up the road to Jūrakuji (7) and do it early. While there I met an American girl
from Hawaii named Sydney. She was pretty cute. She had nowhere to stay that
night so I took out my Japanese map and showed her the location of an offical
Henro Hut nearby. I'll probably see her again.

Once back at Anrakuji, lo-and-behold, Takahara-san was standing at the entrance.
Apparently he had gotten quite lost in the afternoon, but was otherwise fine. He
soon set off for the next temple. We then found someone else in the Bell Tower,
a tatami maker from Kyōto named Kenji-san. It's the three of us here tonight.

Osettai: Breakfast, candles, incense, a handle cover for my staff, eggs and
water, chocolate.

Post-trip Addendum:

/Osettai/ is a pilgrim hospitality culture specific to Shikoku. The locals know
how hard the journey is, so they offer whatever help they can, often in the form
of food or drinks.

I came with a tent packed for days that I'd sleep outside. I hoped for about a
50/50 split between that and staying in inns. When you're walking the pilgrimage
route it's basically impossible to plan ahead of time (re: reservations), since
you don't know how far you'll get each day. There's a lot of playing it by ear.

Temples generally don't close their gates, but the temple offices where you
receive proof of passage open at 8 a.m. So no matter how quickly you arrive
there in the morning, you can't continue until past 8. Hence it's part of a
walker's strategy to position the previous night's lodging about 2 hours away
from the next temple. You start walking at 6, get there just before 8, do the
rites, and you're on your way with no time loss.

Original Japanese:

** Day 2 - April 17 (21km)

The ceaseless bombardment from mosquitos and the cement floor of the bell tower
meant I didn't manage much sleep. I gave up at 5 a.m. and hit the road alone.
Sydney wasn't at the Hut nor Kumadaniji (8), so I guess she got lost somewhere.
I saw Takahara-san again at temples 8 and 9. We were surrounded by farmers
fields; it was stereotypical Japanese countryside. Kirihataji (10) was up a
short mountainside, and it felt good to be surrounded by trees again. At a
nearby shop I finally picked up a Sugegasa that would actually fit my head.

Lunch was the biggest bowl of Udon I've eaten in my life. Turns out walking all
day makes you hungry.

By the late afternoon I had reached Fujiidera (11) and stayed the night at
pilgrim-specific placed called Yado Eleven. It seemed rather new and is close to
the foot of the mountain. Tomorrow is a big climb, the first real test for
walking pilgrims.

As a side note, walking alone is much more freeing.

Animals: 4 cats

Osettai: Water, candy, luggage storage, tea, use of a bicycle, a plastic bag.

Post-trip Addendum:

I didn't see Sydney again and have no idea where she could have gone. Jeffery
was also with me at Yado Eleven, and Kenji-san stayed outside. The three of us
had walked together most of the day. Kenji-san and I had dinner together at a
nearby cheap sushi place, but I didn't enjoy spending time with him.

Original Japanese:

蚊の絶えない攻撃と中々 comfortable になれん鐘楼の床でほぼ寝れなかった。五時に諦

そらく迷った。八番と九番でまた高原さんと会った。その辺りは畑ばかりで田舎の象徴。

** Day 3 - April 18 (28km)

I set off at around 5:40. I slept like a log last night. Breaks included, the
climb up to Shōsanji (12) took about 5.5 hours. At Jōren-an I swapped addresses
with Takahara-san; I have the feeling I won't see him again.

I took a longer lunch break and let the others go on ahead. Though hours later I
ran into them again at the foot of the mountain. Kenji-san will be staying at a
hut nearby while the other three of us pressed on to a campsite another hour or
so down the road. A lot of people were nice to us along the way. Tonight my tent
is pitched by a river. It's peaceful here.

Animals: 3 cats, 1 boar(?)

Osettai: Vitamins, a woman washed my cucumbers, water, citrus fruit, words of encouragement.

Post-trip Addendum:

The hike up Shōsanji is quite steep and is the first place that gives pilgrims
real trouble. Apparently a lot of people quit the journey here. It was peaceful
at the top and the air was quite cool. Looking back, that was the most intense
raw hike experience on the trip, probably because it was only the 3rd day and I
wasn't as strong yet. I remember seeing lights in my eyes as I got to the top. I
really had to push myself in some places.

As I thought, I didn't end up seeing Takahara-san again after that day, although
I heard later that he did make it up Shōsanji (reminder: 80 years old) and
continued his journey. As far as I know, he made it as far as he had planned,
about halfway.

I said "the three of us" after Kenji-san stayed behind, since a girl from France
named Barbara had joined up with us during the morning. It was myself, Jeffery,
and her at that campsite that night.

For a long time after this, whenever I was feeling tired or daunted by a
mountain climb or long stretch of road, I'd ask "Is this harder than Shōsanji?"
and the answer was always no. So on I went.

Original Japanese:

五時四十分出発。夜は快眠で爆睡。焼山寺は休憩を入れて五時間半ぐらい掛かった。浄蓮
庵で高原さんと住所を交換した。もう会わない気がする。お昼の休憩を長目に取って他の
人とはぐれた。が、その何時間後にまた阿野町で会った。けんじさんはそこで泊まり残っ

川端で寝る。

** Day 4 - April 19 (30km)

A strong wind had blown overnight and the air was cool so close to the river.
Once again I woke up around 5 and was gone after 40 minutes of cleanup and
preparations. As I walked, the morning light reflecting off the tree leaves made
me feel the beauty of reality.

It was about 5km to Dainichiji (13) and I arrived around 7:15. As I was waiting
for the Nōkyō Office to open, Kenji-san appeared. I found the timing strange and
he admitted he had set off at 4 that morning.

I continued on through the morning's temples, and stopped once at Temple 17 to
form a plan for the evening. The Shukubō of Tatsueji (19) was full, so instead I
called an inn called "Minshuku Chiba" nearby Temple 18 and booked a room there.
Unfortunately, it was another 20km further from where I was, and it was already
noon.

I lost about 1km in Tokushima City getting turned around the winding streets,
but in the end I made it to the inn just before 5. The road had been long and
hot, but I made it. Who knew what the human mind-body was capable of. Somehow
Barbara also showed up at Chiba later that evening. Jeffery had apparently
headed into the city proper and must have stayed somewhere there.

Animals: 2 cats

Osettai: Advice

Post-trip Addendum:

"Shukubō" are official accomodations within a temple, including meals. I had
very poor Shukubō luck this trip, only managing a single night's stay over the
47 days, and only because it was up a mountain and off the main pilgrim path at
a secondary temple. Worth it though.

Today was the last time I saw Kenji-san.

Original Japanese:

夜は涼しく風が強く吹いていた。また五時起きで約四十分で片付けと準備が出来て一人で
出発した。朝日が反射して来る木々の葉っぱは綺麗で現実を感じた。

大日寺まで約五粁、七時十五分頃に着いた。納経所が開くのを待っていると、けんじさん
が姿を現す。四時に出発したと言う。そうやって七番目まで行き、そこで夜の計画を立て
た。十九番の立江寺の宿坊は空きがないと言うので十八番の近くの「民宿ちば」に電話で
予約を入れた。距離はこの先二十粁。

一回徳島市内で迷って一粁位は損したけれど結局十七時ちょっと前にに到着した。道は長
くて暑かったがまた歩けた。人間はすごい。Barbaraも夕方、ちばに現れた。

** Day 5 - April 20 (20km)

"You're telling me these people have completed the route over 100 times? How on
earth is that possible?"

The inn owner's answer was simple: "By car."

From the other side of the room an older, veteran Henro pilgrim spoke up.
"That's not true Henro, that's little more than stamp collecting." He meant it.
At the time I thought him just a gruff old guy from the countryside, but later
in day at a temple he taught me how to do the cleansing ritual properly, and how
to better carry my Sanya Bag so it would balance out the weight better.

I quite liked Tatsueji (19). The monk at the Nōkyō Office told me a lot about
his training when I asked. He had spent 8 years atop Kōyasan, and finally came
back to Shikoku as this was his first master's temple.

Kakurinji (20) was up another mountain and was quite peaceful. The climb was
steep. The temple staff told me that I'd be able to sleep at an abandoned
elementary school in the village at the foot of the mountain. Just as I got down
and reached the school, it started to rain. Tonight I've pitched my tent under
the eaves of the gymnasium, with many swallow nests overhead. This school was
founded over 100 years ago, but at the moment is "not in use".

Animals: 1 cat, 2 mountain birds, 1 murder hornet

Post-trip Addendum:

A Sanya Bag is white and holds one's pilgrimage supplies, like the map,
candles and incense, prayer beads, etc. It's to be worn hanging in front, not
over the shoulder as I had been doing. Apart from this I also had my proper
hiking backpack of course, which weighed between 9 and 11kg depending on my
supplies of food and water that day.

The school being "out of service" is a growing trend in Japan, as economic
prosperity since the end of WW2 has spurred new opportunity and incentivised the
younger generations to flock to the cities. With fewer and fewer children in the
distant country towns, schools eventually close, which seals the loop. With no
schools, new families can't take up there, and the fate of the town is sealed.

I saw Barbara for the last time briefly at Tatsueji.

Original Japanese:

「１００回なんてどうやって廻るんですか」とちばの店主に訊くと「車だよ」と。横から

** Day 6 - April 21 (23km)

I wasn't eaten by the ghosts of lost children during the night. Barbara didn't
show up at the school, nor was she at Tairyūji (21), so I have no clue how far
she walked yesterday or where she ended up sleeping.

Today was another mountain climb, and it was absolutely worth it. Tairyūji is
also called "The Kōya of the West" and I found it quite serene and magical. I
got there before 8 and the entire place was enveloped in fog. There was no one
else around. Once the office opened, I bought a few gifts and a small
Kūkai-specific prayer bead bracelet for my wrist. Once back on the Henro trail,
you soon come to a place where Kūkai is said to have trained in his youth. Now,
atop a boulder overlooking the surrounding countryside, is a large seated statue
of him. Unfortunately due to the fog I couldn't see anything, but we had a good
chat. After promising to meet again, I continued on.

The path through the mountains was utterly silent. Partway through I passed by a
pilgrim walking in the opposite temple order and we wished each other luck.
Otherwise, there was nobody and nothing but me and the trees. After a few hours
I finally popped out into civilization and reached [[https://byodoji.online/en][Byōdōji]] (22). Once I'm back,
I definitely have to look this place up again. At the Nōkyō Office, they told me
about another abandoned school I could sleep at 2 hours further up the road.
Another chance for the ghosts, maybe.

Ah, and something I forgot to mention. As I had gotten through the mountains, it
started to pour. I had to pull out my rain gear for the first time, and it
performed wonderfully. I was especially pleased with my boots and socks; not wet
at all. At the moment I'm waiting out the rain in a Henro rest hut at Fukui
Elementary School. I'll sleep here tonight. Tomorrow I only plan to do a half
day in order to save my energy for the 3-day dash I'll soon be doing down the
coast.

Animals: 1 cat, 6 frogs, 5 mountain crabs, 1 murder hornet

Post-trip Addendum:

At [[https://byodoji.online/en][Byōdōji]] I was told that the old abbot's son recently took over, and has since
released a website, phone app, and streaming videos of their rituals and
services. Like, how many Buddhist monks can you picture [[https://www.twitch.tv/byodoji][Twitch streaming]] their
Flame Rituals? At least these guys are!

** Day 7 - April 22 (16km)

Wide awake at 4:30. As usual, there's no one else around. I ate everything I
had, including my emergency Calorie Mate, and headed off. The town of Hiwasa and
the last temple of Tokushima, Yakuōji (23), are about a 4.5 hour walk away.

I first passed through the small coastal fishing town of Yuki. I wandered over
to the harbour and sat next to the nearest drink machine I could find, sipping
some canned coffee and resting my tight shoulder. The harbour cats roamed for
scraps. An old lady wandered by and we chatted for 20 minutes or so about the
town and its future. She said that while there's still an elementary school,
there's nobody left to take over the rice fields; the generation that should
have moved to the city instead. Apparently Hiwasa is still better off.

She was right, Hiwasa had much more going for it. I imagine that's in no small
part thanks to the train station and the temple atop the hill, Yakuōji. As I
finished my pilgrim's routine within the temple, who shows up from the dead but
Jeffery. Apparently he hit temples 20, 21, and 22 in a single day, which is
quite the load of mountain climbing. He opted to continue on from Hiwasa, while
I'm resting here for the rest of the day. Tomorrow I begin the 3-day journey to
Muroto.

Animals: 6 Harbour Cats

Post-trip Addendum:

That was the last I saw Jeffery in person. He ended up finishing the 88-temple
pilgrimage a full 10 days earlier than me, in 36 days. That's considered quite
fast, and he could only have done so by /averaging/ 30km per day, which
essentially means walking hard every day and never taking a day off. For
comparison, my daily average over this first week was ~22km. He later messaged
me that he wished he had taken his time a bit more and enjoyed the sights. I
honestly don't know how he didn't wreck his feet.

The gap between temples 23 and 24 is about 80km and typically takes 3 days to
walk. It's a walking pilgrim's second test. But at the end is Muroto Cape, where
Kūkai is said to have reached enlightenment.

Original Japanese:

四時半頃に起きた。相変わらず誰も居ない。非常食の Calorie Mate まで食べて片付けて
出発。四時間位歩けば薬王寺のある日和佐に辿り着くはず。

由岐と云う漁の町に出ると、まず港に向かい休憩を取った。コーヒーを飲んでいると地元
のお婆ちゃんが寄って来て二十分程町の事を話してくれた。小学校はまだあるが漁が減っ
ているし田んぼの後継ぎは都会に行ってしまっている。日和佐の方はまだましらしい。

その日和佐に着いて薬王寺でお参りを済ませたら Jeffery が現れた。２０、２１、２２
を一日で廻ったと言う。相当な登山だな！彼は先へ進み、俺は今日この町で少しゆっくり
する。明日から三日で室戸まで歩く。

動物：浜猫６

** Day 8 - April 23 (31km)

I was on the road by 5:15. It wasn't quite raining then, but started soon and
didn't stop all day. My rain gear held out and kept my body dry. However, 8
hours of exposure was more than enough to soak my backpack's rain bag through,
and the contents were a bit wet. My sleeping bag was absolutely waterlogged.
Aren't I glad I saved 72 grams but not bringing its own protective bag along?

Along the way I passed by Saba-Taishi (Bekkaku 4). Despite being a Bekkaku, it
was splendid enough to rival any of the nicer official 88 temples I had seen so
far. It had a "Kannon Cave" as well, with a Gomadō at its core where a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acala][Fudō-Myō-ō]] is venerated. The staff in the Nōkyō office helped me pick a lodge
for the evening, and an older man who must have been the Abbot gave me some
canned green tea for the road. Their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingon_Buddhism#Goma_fire_ritual][Goma rituals]] are every Sunday at 10:00, and
I'd definitely like to come back at some point.

From there it was 3 hours to the surf shack. The owner is a former pro surfer in
his late 60s, and his wife - apparently his second - is much younger than he is.
They have a 1-year-old named Shiki. For dinner they offered some Anroku, which
is a very rare form of seaweed that can only be harvested during a 10-day period
each year, a period which happens to be right now. Lucky me! It was really quite
good, and turns an interesting shade of light green with only a second or so of
exposure to boiling water.

Animals: 12 cats

Post-trip Addendum:

The "Bekkaku" (lit. different level) temples are 20 extra temples along the
route, not included in the original 88. However, 88 + 20 = 108, the number of
human "worries" named by Buddhism, and this gives them semi-special status. But
since they're not in the main 88 and are sometimes out of the way, they often
get fewer pilgrims. That said, I found them splendid in their own right. They
also sell a unique prayer bead with their temple's name engraved on it - collect
all 20 and you can form a full [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_prayer_beads][Juzu]]! I hadn't got to the first 3 Bekkaku, but
once I picked up the bead at the 4th I was hooked. I ended up taking the extra
time to visit the rest, except 1, 2, 3, and 20. Next time.

* Kōchi Prefecture - The Long Coast

** Day 9 - April 24 (24km)

I slept well. My sleeping bag, which should have dried over night hanging where
it was, had somehow gotten even wetter from the damp air. Once breakfast was
over, the owner drove me back up to Kaifu to dry my things at a Laundromat. Once
we got back, I set off right away. It was already 8. It was raining as hard as
yesterday, so on I went.

At Shishikui I finally found an available barber. Seriously: middle of the day,
middle of the countryside, a weekday, yet 5 barbers in a row were filled with
old folks cutting hair for other old folks. Once in the chair we had a good
chat. Apparently a good number of pilgrims stop by his place, especially since
it's directly on the pilgrimage route. About an hour after I left his place, he
appeared out of the blue in his car with some baked goods for me. I thanked him
while wondering who was watching the shop.

I hid from the rain for about half an hour at Meitokuji, a small temple not part
of the main 88 but on the map nonetheless. No one seemed to be home. After that
it was just a matter of trudging through the rain until I reached my destination
for the night around 15:30, a small roofed hut on the side of the highway. It
was right by the ocean with nothing before or after it for a good stretch.
Tomorrow is a 30km day. Unfortunately, the Shukubō at the cape's temple is
already full.

** Day 10 - April 25 (28km)

There was no Tsunami to wash me away during the night, but the inside of my tent
was still a bit damp when I awoke. And apparently, unlike lakes, the ocean
doesn't calm down at night. Or at least around here it doesn't.
Regardless, I wiped down the inside of the tent and dried out the fly a bit
before leaving around 6:00. Unlike the past two days, the sky was clear of clouds.

An older married couple made me lunch half an hour earlier than their usual
opening time. Apparently their granddaughter had spent some time in Canada.

At the cape, the view from the cliff-side lighthouse was fantastic. Deep, clear
blues from both the sky and sea. The temple, on the other hand, was fairly
plain. Since their Shukubō was full, I headed back down the mountain to a cheap
inn called "Kawasaki", where the owner was, shall we say, quite "honest" in her
speech. She kindly informed me how much I stank and promptly drew a bath for me.
There had been some mixup with my reservation (being forgotten), but it all
turned out in the end.

Animals: 6 cats, 1 murder hornet

Post-trip Addendum:

At the temple I ran into Tomatsu-san again, an actual monk walking the
pilgrimage in the traditional robes. I had met him the first time a day or two
previously near the town of Mugi as we were both being poured on by the sky. He
was trying to avoid inns as much as possible, which I assume is part of the
training. Sophie was at the temple too, a french woman who I had also briefly
met at Yakuōji (23) three days before.

** Day 11 - April 26 (25km)

I was up before 5:00 and out the door soon after. I didn't really want to
interact with the owner anymore, and didn't have to since it was so early. The
temple wasn't actually that far, so after scoping out its location I went and
grabbed breakfast at a convenience store. After completing the temple routine, I
killed some time reading a book while waiting for the Nōkyō office to open.

The climb up to Kongōchōji (26) wasn't bad at all. After that it was just
another long walk. Hours later, just short of my lodging for the night, it
decided to start drizzling. The town, Nahari, was otherwise nice.

You'd think my feet would be impervious by this point, but a blister on my right
heel has suddenly worsened and walking is becoming painful. I think tomorrow is
going to be a rest day, just in case.

Animals: 1 cat

Osettai: Mochi, gum, tea

Post-trip Addendum:

I was actually worried that I would have some critical foot issue and would have
to halt the pilgrimage, but that never happened. By this point I was used to
dealing with blisters, so I was surprised at this one. As a full-time walker,
you have no choice but to drain blisters when they form. I always did so with
scissors from my multitool, some disinfectant, and bandages. This nasty guy
required a somewhat deep cut to get at the liquid, and what came out was an
oddly red-tinged yellow (and a good amount of it). Fortunately, that was the
second last blister of the entire route.

I haven't mentioned food much, but breakfasts at convenience stores were a
fairly regular occurance. What else is open that early?

Original Japanese:

五時前に起きてすぐに出た。寺は比較的近かった為、まずコンビニに寄って朝食を済ませ

動物：猫１

お接待：餅・ガム・茶

** Day 12 - April 27

A full rest day to see how much my blister heals. The graves of the "23
Warriors" were at a temple nearby, so I checked that out.

For lunch, the owner of the inn took me to a famous ramen place nearby. The put
the biggest lump of butter in there I've ever seen in a ramen. Man was it good.

Osettai: Onigiri, lodging

Post-trip Addendum:

The 23 Warriors had been executed somewhat unceremoniously after a pseudo-cout
back in the 1800s. A farewell poem that the wife of the leader wrote after he
died is carved into a pillar by the graves. Overall there was a lot of upheaval
in Japan at the time, and as we know, the modernizers won out.

Bless the owner, she only charged me for dinner on the second day and not the
housing itself. Since we were also on the cusp of Golden Week, she told me that
if I couldn't manage to find something in the Kōchi City area over the next few
days that I could hop on a train and come back to her place, again for free.

Original Japanese:

休足日。二十三士の墓のある寺に行って見た。昼食は有名なラーメン屋に一緒に連れて行っ

** Day 13 - April 28 (32km)

Thanks to my day off yesterday I felt fresh and kept a great pace. The climb up
to Kōnomineji (27) was a breeze, even with my pack. Once back down, my feet just
kept carrying me forward, and before I knew it I was in Aki City. It was about
noon and starting to get hot. I wanted to hit the nearest Onsen, but as I walked
up to it I saw it opens at 15:00. No way I'm waiting around for 3 hours. I opted
for a break instead and settled down on a nearby bench.

A tsunami siren blared through the air. I rushed to get my shoes back on to flee
for safety... when the alarm stopped. I looked around. The locals were going
about their day as if nothing had happened. I glanced at my watch: 12 noon.
Feeling a bit embarassed I sat back down and resumed my break.

Oh and by the way: I was wrong about the sea the other day. It does actually
calm down at night when the weather is good.

Close to the beach near Wajiki station I found a great hut with a bathroom. Home
sweet home.

Animals: 5 cats, 1 snake

Post-trip Addendum:

Most (all?) places in Japan play a song over public loud speakers at 17:00. It's
a signal that the day is (supposed to be) over and that's it's time to go home.
Some smaller places will also broadcast something at noon, and Aki in particular
decided to reuse their tsunami alarm for this purpose. The Japanese culture is
used to having deafeningly loud sounds blast through the air from time to time.
I assume it's a leftover from the air-raid sirens of World War 2.

Original Japanese:

休足日のお陰で朝から絶好調で飛ばせた。神峯寺への登山は荷物を背負っても割と楽だっ

** Day 14 - April 29 (24km)

The rain waited until I got to Dainichiji (28) but it hasn't stopped since then.
A henro hut is the best I can do for lodging today, but at least it's a nice
one. There is an Onsen only 2km away, so I passed the afternoon there and had
dinner before trudging back through the rain to the hut. Luckily no one had
claimed it in the interim.

Animals: 3 cats, 1 suppon, 4 white sagi

Post-trip Addendum:

I had only packed one small towel, which I unfortunately lost somewhere around
Miroto cape. It must have fallen while I was walk-drying it. Nagaoka Onsen,
where I spent the afternoon, had some for sale so I picked one up. That guy
lasted the rest of the pilgrimage, and he's currently safe in the closet of my
Tokyo apartment. Every time I pulled him out during the trip I remembered how
Nagaoka Onsen had come through for me that rainy day.

** Day 15 - April 30 (19km)

As long as my tent is under a roof I can sleep without the fly on. The tent
itself won't get wet, and I stay cool during the night.

I reached Kokubunji (29) almost right away, and the rain let up just then. The
sun peaked through the clouds, and with no one else around, I had a few minutes
of peace in the quiet temple grounds. Of the temple itself I can only say that
"they're doing it right". Some temples don't try that hard or don't "look the
part", but this one does. I'd say #2 after Tairyūji in terms of atmosphere.

By the afternoon I was in Kōchi City proper and ready for some sightseeing. I
swung by the castle, watched some old guys play Shōgi, and rewarded my recent
efforts with some celebratory Yakiniku.

Animals: 8 sagi, 3 cats

Post-trip Addendum:

There are 4 temples named "Kokubunji" in Shikoku, and this was the second one.
There is one in each prefecture, as was mandated by the emperor in the 700s.

I had never been to Kōchi prefecture before this, let alone the city of the same
name, so coming this far was another victory.

Apart from the Yakiniku I also made a trip to the local Mont Bell, an outdoor
goods store. I picked up some "casual socks" and convinced another customer to
buy the very socks I was wearing, my invincible, form-fitting pair.

Original Japanese:

雨が降っても、屋根があれば fly 無しでもテント内は濡れない。これで涼しいまま寝れ
る。歩き出したらすぐに国分寺に着いて雨も止んでくれた。この寺はとにかく静かで綺麗。
よく「お寺」をやっている。太龍寺の次に雰囲気がよかった。

** Day 16 - May 1 (35km)

It was truly raining right from the get-go this morning, and I was angry about
it. The weatherman had betrayed me, and my right shoulder was oddly in pain.
Chikurinji (31) and Zenjibuji (32) were both mountain climbs I hadn't expected,
which irritated me further. There were apparently interesting special exhibits
on at Chikurinji, but the rain and my schedule urged me onward. I took the hard
way down and the rough, stony trail was quite slippery, but it didn't kill me
and I enjoyed the victory despite being soaked.

At the ferry terminal, I met a woman who had moved from Tōkyō to Hokkaidō and
loved it there. Apparently of all her travels, she found it the most beautiful.
Were I to go, what would I need? And what about timing?

I had counted on being able to stay at Tanemaji (34), but was turned away. It
was still too early in the day for them to permit people into the Tsūyadō. In a
rush I called around the area and found a place with an opening about an hour up
the road. I was lucky; that place filled up too immediately after that, and was
actually over-booked.

Animals: Tons of crab, several sagi.

Post-trip Addendum:

It was this day that changed my mind about Calorie Mate. My emergency bar saved
me in an area by the coast where there was just nothing to eat in the afternoon,
no shops, no cafés, no convenience stores. At some point I pulled off out of the
rain, and under someone's eaves downed the four small shortcake bars. 400
calories. Nothing much in them but flour and butter, but hey, it saved my
afternoon mood.

I say "ferry terminal" but it was a very small, free one provided by the city.
The trip was about 5 minutes, but saved probably an hour of walking.

If you're going to stay in a Tsūyadō, arrive at the temple past 16:00 or so.
Otherwise they're going to tell you that you still have time to make progress
and shoo you out.

Original Japanese:

** Day 17 - May 2 (26km)

I didn't sleep well and was already walking by 5:30.

The temple, Kiyotakiji (35), was nice. It was a 100m or so climb from the valley
to the temple, and the view down on Tosa City was fantastic.

Once in Usa I found the lodging situation to be... not good. Another temple
full, as were all the surrounding inns. There were two ways forward, and at the
temple's suggestion I avoided the highway and retraced my steps back over the
big bridge and headed up the coast that way. It's the "long way around" but
there's a short ferry you can take in between. Apparently Kūkai did it that way
too, so it's not cheating. That'll be tomorrow.

The sun was wanting to set as I took a short break by a small, roadside shop. An
old lady came out and gave me some citrus fruit and something deepfried. They
were both delicious, although the fruit was filled with seeds. This is real
life, I thought to myself.

A bit past that I found the inn "Nazuna", a place that had been recommended to
me before but I knew was full. I asked if they knew anywhere I could throw my
tent down for the night, and they offered to let me pitch it in their driveway
for a fee. Another lucky night!

Animals: 20, yes 20, cats

Osettai: Bread, citrus fruit, something deepfried, snacks, tea

Original Japanese:

よく眠れなかった。五時半までにもう歩いていた。

[[/assets/images/henro/0502-tosa.jpg]]

** Day 18 - May 3 (32km)

After what I wrote last night, the owners of the inn called me into the house
and fed me a bit more, which they weren't at all obligated to do. I got a chance
to chat with the other guests, who apparently had made their booking months ago.

At some point past midnight, I was woken by a sound near the garbage cans.
Something was in a tree. I got out of my tent and shone a light at it, and
golden, twirling eyes stared back at me. A demon monkey from hell, I concluded,
but we agreed that I'd get back in my tent if he agreed not to come down and
feast on my soul.

The next morning I waited and waited at the small ferry terminal, but no boat
ever came. A careful inspection of the small, posted schedule stated "no service
on holidays". It was a Friday, but technically still Golden Week, so that must
have been it. While I was waiting I had read a lot and made some great personal
discoveries, so the time was fruitful after all. Maybe a gift, even.

I had no choice but to press on on foot. Tonight's lodging is a henro hut at the
foot of my next mountain climb.

Animals: 3 cats, 1 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamushi][mamushi]]

Osettai: a morning Bentō, citrus

Post-trip Addendum:

This was also the day I visited Bekkaku 5, Daizenji.

[[/assets/images/henro/0503-hut.jpg]]

** Day 19 - May 4 (32km)

Last night I caught a monster spider hanging out on the hut wall near my tent,
but this morning she was no where to be seen. I began the mountain climb at
6:00, and other than the stair section at the beginning it was no trouble.
Before I realized it I had already popped out onto the road again. It was a
clear, blue morning.

In a small mountain town I found a café and ordered breakfast, which one of the
other patrons paid for. She also gave me her hard-boiled egg as she and the
other old ladies peppered me with questions. Later, around noon, as I was
walking the highway again she appeared in her car and handed me lunch, fruit,
and some tea. I was shocked by both her kindness and her effort. Thank you,
truly.

Iwamotoji (37) was another "well done" temple. The surrounding town is called
Kubokawa and I found it quite a lively place. I'll admit that some part of me is
also scoping out Shikoku for potential places to live, should I ever decide to
move here.

Apparently there were no bath houses in the area, so I had no choice but to move
on. I'm at another Henro Hut tonight, sandwiched by a roadway and river.
Tomorrow I'll finally reach Tosa Saga.

Animals: 1 mamushi

Osettai: Breakfast, candies, tea, onigiri, fruit, etc.

Post-trip Addendum:

Through some smaller mountain pass I found myself on a thin trail cut out of the
ground in the shape of a halfpipe. Lying in the middle was a mamushi, the
deadliest snake in Japan. Poking the ground with my staff got him moving, but he
couldn't make it all the way up the steep wall of the trail and kept falling
back down. Eventually I took as wide of a berth around him as I could manage and
just ran past. He didn't follow. Adrenaline surged through my body and I felt
like I had passed a test.

Original Japanese:

昨夜の化け蜘蛛は見当たらん。六時登山開始。最初の階段以外は簡単だった。気付くとも

** Day 20 - May 5 (23km)

It was a straightforward day. I set off at 6, and after two hours found myself
in Tosa Saga. After feasting on some Katsuo-tataki at a Michi-no-eki, I took a
video of the surroundings for Wataru and the guys.

I got a bit lost on a mountain path, but soon found my way back out again.

After walking for ages I finally reached the outskirts of Shimanto City. Tonight
I'll be staying at a campsite for surfers. A few of them came over to talk to
me, and pretty soon they were sharing their BBQ with me. We had some good
conversations. One in particular was memorable; the young owner of a local
fertilizer company and I discussed the relationship between big cities like
Tōkyō and the countryside. From his perspective, he's grateful to the cities for
creating a market for the countryside to sell to.

Apropos nothing, I had the feeling that I need more control over my time.

Animals: 10 sagi

Osettai: Meat, mochi, tea

Post-trip Addendum:

I hadn't bathed in four days. The campsite had a coin-operated
shower, but 5-minutes max, cold water only. It's meant for the surfers to wash
sand off themselves. As I stood naked in the stall with the coin in my hand, I
thought "it's this or being dirty for another day". I put the coin in... and it
was fine. The cold-water baths you find in Onsens are colder. Humans aren't
weak.

The town of Tosa Saga was a joke-milestone, as I used to live in Saga City in
Kyūshū. Wataru is a friend from that era who I still meet up with in Tōkyō.

Original Japanese:

割と分かりやすい一日だった。六時出発で二時間歩くと土佐佐賀に到着した。道の駅で鰹

** Day 21 - May 6 (25km)

It was another night in the tent, and the surfers had warned me it was supposed
to rain overnight. Would this be my first morning packing up a wet tent?

My eyes popped open at 3:45. I felt around and realized it hadn't started
raining yet. "No time like the present" - I jumped out of the tent, packed up
with the fear it could pour at any moment, and headed off into the predawn
darkness. Never have I walked in such blackness. To my left was the sea, to my
right the woods. I pressed on like this for a few kilometers, when it occured to
me that I was alive. Nothing had sprang out and eaten me, so I rightly concluded
that werewolves don't in fact exist. I glanced up at the moon anyway.

Around 8 I found a small countryside Udon restaurant, somehow open, and I had
Tantan Udon. Not much further past that it finally started to rain, and rain it
did. I reached today's lodging, "Anjuku", by noon, and it was truly pouring. The
wind had been in my direction the full length of the valley, so I was quite wet
despite all my protection. Luckily I've already booked tomorrow's lodging, and
it isn't supposed to rain.

Animals: Many sagi, many mountain frogs

Osettai: candies

Post-trip Addendum:

The early-morning walk through the darkness was one of my favourite moments of
the pilgrimage.

Original Japanese:

三時四十五分に目が覚めた。夜中に雨が降らなかった事に気づき、敢えて起きてテントを

** Day 22 - May 7 (26km)

The path to the cape and back up is varied. There are two ways down and around
four ways back up. The wife of the inn owner suggested that I avoid the coast
today and instead head through Shimizu City, looping back down and around to the
cape. That way, I'll maximize variety and be able to walk back up the eastern
coast properly tomorrow morning.

There was another reason to go through Shimizu instead: food. The eastern coast
has very little along it besides small fishing villages. In Shimizu I found a
café and had brunch around 9:30. And man, the long beach at Ōki was fantastic. I
walked the whole length of it and took a break on the sand. I gazed at the sea
and felt peace. I wondered when sand first came to be, and thought to ask my
sister.

The temple, Kongōfukuji (38), was a spectacle. Another very "well done" temple.
The main gate was beautiful, and the statues all around make Shingon seem a
little truer. Maybe.

Tomorrow it's about time I really did some distance. Now that I'm at the second
cape, the journey is about half over. The day after tomorrow I'll be out of
Kōchi and into Ehime, the next stage of the training. Kōchi was long but not
overwhelming. Sure I got rained on and had to sleep outside for a few days in a
row, but never once did I think of quitting.

Animals: 1 cat

Osettai: Nigiri, candies, some extra dinner

Post-trip Addendum:

The real reason I wanted to go faster was because I got a message from Jeffery
(remember him?). He was somehow already in the 40s, several full walking days
ahead of me. Even accounting for the day I rested, he still must have been
really pushing every day. This made me feel somehow behind, despite the locals
telling me I was going at a good pace.

I'm reminded of the words of a old lady at a particular temple:

#+begin_quote
It doesn't matter what other people are doing. The Henro Path is exactly the
path you chose to walk.

** Day 23 - May 8 (47km)

Today I got a glimpse of my limits. At the moment I'm set up for the evening at
a large dam in the mountains. I left the cape at 5:30 this morning and headed
back up the eastern cost. The weather was perfect. Back near the long beach a
local told me not to treck down the rockier path, since the rain had washed out
the usual sand bridge. I went anyway and jumped the tiny river that had formed.
No issue.

By 10:30 I was back at the inn from the previous day and grabbed a quick lunch.
That's already a good 20km walk. There, I talked with the owner about my options
for the evening. I was thinking about heading for a campsite a few hours up the
road. He suggested I instead go another 10+ km further than that to a dam,
saying there's a park there where I could sleep wherever I want.

#+begin_quote
I'll get to the campsite first and then weigh my options.
#+end_quote

By 15:00 I was at the campsite. The road to it peeled off from the main road and
wound down to the riverside. There wasn't a soul in sight. Furthermore, I had no
water. None even for drinking, let alone cooking. I had drank it all working my
way up the narrow yet scenic mountain road. There were outdoor taps here, but no
way to know where they draw from. I checked my map again. Another few kilometers
to Mihara, and then another handful more after that to the dam. It was only
15:00...

I got to the dam just past 18:00. I was active for a full 12 hours today. And
you know what? I was in pretty good shape. Nowhere near as beaten up as I
thought I'd be. I had pasta for dinner, alone(?) in the mountains.

Animals: 3 cats, 2 snakes, 4 "badgers"

Osettai: Citrus, nigiri, candies

Post-trip Addendum:

This was the furthest I ever walked in one day. I thought to myself at the time
"I could have gone 50", which means if I really needed to push it or someone's
life was on the line, who knows how far I could go?

As I was setting up my tent, a gray van rolled slowly by. I couldn't see in the
windows; the van was filled with trash and belongings. The nearby dam had a
control building where employees must be during the day, and I had noticed a
number of cars in its parking lot, and yet the building itself seemed dark. My
guess was that the cars actually belonged to nomads, just one step away from
homelessness.

* Ehime Prefecture - Ascendance

** Day 24 - May 9 (33km)

The murder van from last night rolled slowly by again at 5:20 this morning.
Filled with trash I couldn't see the driver. What kind of life could that be? So
I was neither murdered nor was I eaten by the wild boar that nearby signs warned
me of.

The grounds of Enkōji (39) weren't very large, but it was quite clean. It was a
really peaceful morning. After that it wasn't far to the prefectural border, and
I finally, finally left Kōchi and entered Ehime. Come to think of it, it's been
12 days since I last rested and my feet are starting to hurt. Yesterday was also
quite the haul.

I reached Kanjizaiji (40) around 15:00. I ran into Sophie again, and also bought
a new bandana with the Kannon Sutra printed on it. Something of a good luck
charm.

My lodging for the night was perhaps another kilometer up the road. The old lady
had been running it for 50 years. She took me to dinner at a local place and she
told me about her life. She's 79. She lost her husband to alcohol 26 years ago,
but she has her kids around for support. Her husband was a fisherman.

Osettai: extra dinner, a discount at the inn

Post-trip Addendum:

That was the last I saw of Sophie. She told me that she'd be zipping ahead the
next day by bus, since she was a bit behind schedule and there isn't a temple
for another 2 or 3 walking days.

Hiking through the border mountains I met Agatha for the first time, a German
graphic designer. She'll come up again in a few weeks.

Whenever I was afraid I would chant the middle section of the Kannon Sutra from
memory. It describes terrible situations a person can find themselves in (being
thrown off mountains, dunked into lava pits, surrounded by demons, etc.) and how
that danger can be cast off by 念彼観音力, roughly put into English as "thinking
on / believing in the power of Kannon". That sounds like spiritual, faith-based
belief that someone used to the notions of Christianity might assume, but there
are varying interpretations. I chose to interpret it meaning "my inner
potential" as a human being, an on-going theme of my pilgrimage. And it actually
works. I chanted it through every car tunnel I walked through (there were many).
It still works now, even back home.

Original Japanese:

昨夜目撃した殺人バンは今朝の五時二十分頃にまたゆっくりと通って行った。ゴミで一杯
で運転手が見えん。どう云う人生だろうか。あとどうやら猪も現れていない。

延光寺は境内がそれ程広くなかったが清潔の意味で綺麗だった。平和な朝だった。それか
らひたすら歩いた。そして松尾峠を超えてやっと愛媛に入った。

そろそろ足が痛い。昨日のせいか。寺には三時頃に着いた。そこでまたフランスの
Sophie と会った。日和佐から時々会う人。宿のお婆ちゃんが五十年も宿をやっていると
言って一緒に夜ご飯を食べに行った。七十九歳。夫は飲みすぎて二十六年前になくなって
いる。漁師だった。

** Day 25 - May 10

I took today off. I was the only one staying at the inn (a house, really), and
the owner wanted to show me her town. She drove me up a hill and we visited the
museum of the "Shidenkō", a fighter plane from World War 2. This particular one
had been shot down and crashed into the water nearby the town, and was
rediscovered by a diver and lifted out to great fanfare about 50 years ago. The
owner and her family watched it happen. Six fighters failed to return during
that particular battle, and this was thought to be one of them. Of the six
missing pilots, only one was married, and he had a newly born daughter. Reading
the testimonies of surviving family members moved me. They weren't bad people.

Tomorrow I will walk as far as Bekkaku #6.

Post-trip Addendum:

I had a realization about Blame. "Fault" implies both /cause/ and /responsibility/
for fixing. Think of a traffic accident. If you are "at fault", you are both the
primary cause of the issue, and the one to pay for damages. This is the legal
definition of Fault. But, between people, I think /cause/ and /responsibility/ must
be split. Yes, others may have been the cause of some trauma I experienced in my
past, but it remains my responsibility to fix it.

"To blame" means "to apply fault".

If you assume that cause and responsibility are linked into "fault", you can get
stuck because:

1. You may be unable to "collect on the debt" because:
  - The person is dead.
  - It's been a very long time since the incident.
  - It's impractical to "ligitate" because they live far way, etc.
  - It may not be clear who the causer even is.
2. Collecting on the debt may not heal the damage anyway.
3. You are stuck in victim mode and can't mature.

So, it's up to you.

** Day 26 - May 11 (38km)

Today I had to reach Bekkaku 6 before it closed, so I was gone by 5:00.
Tetsuko-san woke up as well and saw me off, waving as I disappeared down the
road. I arrived at the foot of the mountain pass around 7:00, and the hike took
3 hours. No problem at all with my feet.

I reached Uwajima by 16:00 or so, still plenty of time to visit the temple.
Their cemetary was impressive in scale, and the lady at the Nōkyō office was
friendly.

The inn I stayed at had been renovated from an old house by a young couple.
Apparently their wedding had been a "hitchhike wedding" where they did a
once-around of the whole country. I ask myself why I don't get these kinds of
ideas. I need to dream bigger.

Animals: 4 cats, 1 snake

Original Japanese:

五時頃出発。徹子さんが起きて見送ってくれた。七時前に登山口に着いて登下山は三時間
掛かった。足には問題ない。

宿の若い夫婦がここを古い家から改装して二人で営んでいる。その結婚式も何と
hitchhike wedding であって日本を一周した。自分にはこういう発送がないのはなぜだろ
う。 Dream bigger Colin!
