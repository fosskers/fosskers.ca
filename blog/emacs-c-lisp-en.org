#+TITLE: How much Lisp and C are in Emacs?

Emacs is largely a Lisp program, but has a C core. What's the ratio of SLOC
between the two languages, and how have they changed over time?

Note that:

- C code looked for under ~src/~.
- Lisp code looked for under ~lisp/~.
- C sources in ~lib/~ and ~lib-src/~ are not counted (see README).
- C header files are ignored.
- Comment/blank lines are ignored.

| Emacs Version | Lines of Lisp | Lines of C | Ratio |
|---------------+---------------+------------+-------|
|          29.1 |       1199775 |     306772 |  3.91 |
|          28.2 |       1141528 |     257981 |  4.42 |
|          27.2 |       1100237 |     252476 |  4.36 |
|          26.3 |       1081561 |     235791 |  4.59 |
|          25.3 |       1061723 |     226388 |  4.69 |
|          24.5 |       1042357 |     215830 |  4.83 |

Between 28 and 29 we see a 19% increase in the size of the C. I wonder what
changed? Perhaps the PGTK backend?
