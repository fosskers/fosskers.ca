Emacs is largely a Lisp program, but has a C core. What's the ratio of SLOC
between the two languages, and how have they changed over time?

Note that:

- C code looked for under ~src/~.
- Lisp code looked for under ~lisp/~.
- C sources in ~lib/~ and ~lib-src/~ are not counted (see README).
- C header files are ignored.
- Comment/blank lines are ignored.

| Emacs Version | Lines of Lisp | New Lisp (%) | Lines of C | New C (%) | Lisp/C Ratio |
|---------------+---------------+--------------+------------+-----------+--------------|
|          30.1 |       1245905 |         3.74 |     354775 |     15.62 |         3.51 |
|          29.4 |       1201002 |         5.21 |     306835 |     18.94 |         3.91 |
|          28.2 |       1141528 |         3.75 |     257981 |      2.18 |         4.42 |
|          27.2 |       1100237 |         1.72 |     252476 |      7.07 |         4.36 |
|          26.3 |       1081561 |         1.87 |     235791 |      4.15 |         4.59 |
|          25.3 |       1061723 |         1.86 |     226388 |      4.89 |         4.69 |
|          24.5 |       1042357 |              |     215830 |           |         4.83 |

Between 28 and 29 we see a 19% increase in the size of the C. I wonder what
changed? Perhaps the PGTK backend?

For 30, the increase in C is likely due to the new native JSON parser.
