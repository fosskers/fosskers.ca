= Preface

Kpop Demon Hunters is memorable for more than its music: it is a telling of the
Hero's Story. Beneath the surface it has little to do with Kpop or idols, and it
follows humanity's beloved plot pattern of threat, doubt, adventure, collapse,
rebirth, and final victory.

The book #u[The Origins and History of Consciousness] by Erich Neumann (1949)
describes the growth of individual consciousness within human beings by tracking
our historical development alongside that of our body of myths and legends. It
then contrasts these evolutions with semi-concurrent psychological ones, during
which this claim is made:

#quote[
  As humanity's own psychological development advanced, we projected that advance into our myths.
]

That is to say, we didn't "make up" our legends. We didn't tell ourselves
stories of gods and demons simply to ward off boredom or to control each other.
When I finally watched Kpop Demon Hunters (apparently the last one on Earth to
have done so), it was like a meteor striking my mind. While written by people,
set in a certain time and place, and filled with fictional elements, it also
isn't "made up" in the sense that it contains no truth about the human
experience. Quite the opposite; Kpop Demon Hunters is humanity's favourite
story. It is the story of the Hero - the story of you.

Following Neumann, this article observes Kpop Demon Hunters from three angles;
that of the #u[surface story] itself, that of the #u[mythological layer]
underpinning it, and that of the #u[psychological layer] which reflects those
myths.

Enjoy.

= The World (The Mind)

Demons threaten us and our world. They feast upon the living and feed our soul
energy back to their god-king Gwi-ma (귀마). Standing against these forces are
the Hunters, three Korean female Shaman-warriors charged with the upkeep of the
Honmoon (혼문). They are taught that if they can channel the Honmoon into a
golden state that it will become permanent, and Demons will no longer stalk
humanity. Rumi in particular, a half-human half-demon, believes that the Golden
Honmoon will rid her of her "patterns" - the tell-tale marks of Gwi-ma's
influence borne by every Demon. Only then can she truly live. To accomplish
this, she and her partners daylight as modern pop stars, and use their musical
influence to connect the hearts of their fans and power the Honmoon. They are
close to their goal, the culmination of generations of effort.

Beyond this surface premise, we immediately recognize the split between the
light, Conscious world and the dark, Unconscious underworld. This subsurface
land is vast, and within it dwell things we do not understand. It is ruled by a
power from which individual consciousness first arises, but it is also that same
power that is ever-welcoming, seductive, and all-consuming. The conflict between
upper and lower, light and dark, plays out within the mind of every person and
within our wider societies.

== Gwi-ma (The Great Mother)

// Image: Demons have always haunted our world.

Gwi-ma is ancient, but beaten down and starving in the modern day. It seems he
can see through the Honmoon to some degree but he is not omniscient. He knows
what a boyband is, but he was not aware of Rumi's patterns until Jinu himself
found out.

// Image: "Let me guess... they got away again."

He can physically drag demons through the air and rip them down from above the
Honmoon, but he cannot read all thoughts; he had to ask Jinu what he wanted. Yet
he can at least access people's fears and painful memories.

Mythologically, while depicted as male, Gwi-ma is an avatar of The Great Mother,
the source of all existence. The Great Mother in turn is an aspect of the
Ouroboros - the dragon-snake biting its own tail - a symbol that has appeared in
human engravings and artwork independently across the world for thousands of
years. It represents, among other things, the cycle of energy and time, and thus
that of life and death. Specifically Gwi-ma is an incarnation of The Terrible
Mother. This is not a comment on Gwi-ma's parenting; "Terrible" here does not
mean "lacking skill", but instead "of terror". Gwi-ma is vindictive, merciless,
cannibalistic, and bloodthirsty. His goal is nothing less than the reabsorption
of all conscious humanity back into himself.

Psychologically, Gwi-ma is the bedrock of the Unconscious and its prime mover.
To it, Consciousness is something of an aberration, a growth that it naturally
seeks to smooth back down. He wants the Hunters dead.

== The Hunters (The Conscious Ego)

While Rumi was born into the war she has dedicated her life to, we know nothing
about Mira's induction. Zoey was presumably scouted and trained during high
school, given that Huntrix has already won the Idol Awards five years in a row,
and Zoey states:

#quote[
  Before I joined Huntrix, I felt like my thoughts and my lyrics and all my
  notesbooks were just useless and weird.
]

It's not clear if Mira and Zoey had spiritual powers to begin with, or whether
these were developed with training. They can see the Honmoon, see demons, draw
weapons from the Honmoon's essence, and channel soul power back into the
Honmoon. Seline is their mentor - Rumi's mother is dead, and the fate of the
third Sunlight Sister is unknown.

// Image: Demons are never nice!
// Image: Rumi flipping onto rooves.
// Image: Oh great, my favourite...

The Hunters function as exterminator-assassins, and while very experienced they
know little to nothing about the true nature of demons. Firstly that demons have
emotions, and secondly that Gwi-ma tortures them psychically. Rumi demonstrates
a similar ignorance with regards to Derpy the Tiger.

// "Demons don't feel anything!" -> "Is that what you think?"
// -- Jinu is honestly taken aback here.
// Image: "Do you not hear him in your ear?" -> "What are you talking about?"
// Image: What are you?

// What does this mean psychologically?
//
// "They are things in your unconscious that you didn't know were there."
// "We are largely unaware of the layout and function of our unconscious minds."
// The conscious mind can do violence against the elements of the unconscious.

The weight of this increases when we realize that by this point in their Hunter
careers, they take pleasure in dealing out death in judgement.

// All smiles during _How it's Done_. "These chicks dig murder."
// Let's go kill these guys.
// Laughing backstage about killing the Saja Boys.
// "You're supposed to be dead by now!" She absolutely intended his death. Is this a kids movie?
// Stabbing the ground during Takedown.
// Mira smile: A demon with no feelings doesn't deserve to live.

The Hunters, and more specifically Rumi, represent the Conscious Mind, although
one still developing. They go about their appointed mission, doing violence to
elements of the Unconscious of which they have no understanding. If it's from
"down there", it's to be hated, punished, and pushed back down. The Authorities
demand it.

// Image: Derpy.

== The Honmoon (The Authorities)

// Old Honmoon: the idea that you can perfectly seal away all the darkness and
// imperfection within you if you just work hard enough.
//
// Golden Honmoon probably not desirable.
//
// Gold as a representative of an ideal.
//
// Mental (soul?) state of Honmoon maintainers can affect it.
//
// Irony: Demonic influence weakens the Honmoon, but at the same time a
// weakening and complete destruction is necessary for Rebirth.

== Demons (The Shadow)

// There is certainly a "power" to be gained by being a demon. Teleportation,
// great strength, etc., are a respresentation of this.
//
// Soul suck consumes body.

= Characters
== Jinu the Human

// Image: you have a beautiful soul.

// Jinu wasn't a true heartless demon. He did not enjoy his errand. He had pets.
// He had humour.
//
// Dual motivations for actions. Their "date" scene, and then during the reveal
// of his betryal, he didn't _have_ to tell Rumi anything about his motivations.
// That too perhaps was some form of plea.
//
// After their first fight he was really curious about her.

#quote(attribution: [Jinu])[The memories... I want them erased.]

He was trying to escape from his human.

== Rumi the Liar

Rumi has a problem with the Truth.

She was trying to escape from her demon.

// Running from the Golden debut.
// Lying to Mira.
// Gaslighting Mira.

= Timeline

Kpop Demon Hunters takes place in the spring of 2025, in the same timeline that
we live in. We know this because:

1. The citizens of Seoul are confused whether it's jacket weather or t-shirt weather.
2. Twice's song _Strategy_, which came out in December 2024, is #2 under Huntrix's _How it's Done_.
3. The cell phones have 2020s size, shape, and UI layout.
4. North Korea is dark at night.

// Images: One for each bullet point.

// The story took place over a series of weeks, not months.
//
// They were initially supposed to have 2 weeks of vacation, and then presumably
// a bit more prep until the Idol Awards.
//
// "Okay we have two weeks to fix Rumi's voice." It would have taken at least a
// few days to get all the Golden stuff together after Rumi initially released
// it.

// Mostly in terms of the timing of Rumi and Jinu's meetings.

== The Alley

== The Bathhouse

// He _was_ legitimately curious about her, shown when he was alone in the
// alleyway talking to himself.
//
// "I've taught you well, Jinu." <- not a compliment

== The Talk

== The Signing

== The Date

// Image: Date? No. Eww!
//
// She's saying Eww not because she's unattracted, but because a boundary was
// encroached upon and she wasn't ready for it.

// The "Bye" moment. That was Jinu's honest reaction. She was already walking
// away and she couldn't see him. He didn't walk away with the smirk and swagger
// of someone who was being purely manipulative.

== The Mystery

// If nothing happened between their "Bye" parting and the Free scene, then we
// can only attribute her sudden love confession to "Disney pacing".
//
// "The more I talk to you..." feels strange unless they had some other
// interaction that we weren't shown. We also weren't shown an explicit moment
// of realization that her voice was better. It's borderline a dropped plot
// point. The bracelet handoff / "we might be a thing" moment happened _after_
// Rumi talked to Mira in her bedroom.
//
// The train fight happened in the early morning, otherwise how could she
// contact Jinu so quickly? Presumably after the fight they went back to the
// stadium for more practice.

At first I only felt it, a kind of gap that couldn't be seen but still tugged at
me.

// Basically they must have had an evening they spent together where they did a
// whole lot of talking. Either that or after their awkward parting, one of them
// turned back to go catch the other.

== Free

// The Monmoon reacting to Jinu's singing.
//
// Gwima's voice can't get through to Jinu.
// When the patterns come back, he's resentful and steels himself for the coming encounter.
// Image: Jinu bracing himself.

= The Climax

== Breakup
== Betrayal

// They were both wrong about to how to handle their demons. "That's not how it
// works!" or "Suffering with my mistakes is all I deserve." "Yes it is!" or "We
// just have to push all our flaws down perfectly." This is something she grew
// up believing and has had to believe, and is visibly shocked when it's clear
// that is doesn't work.
//
// He didn't have to tell her the truth. That he did shows his inner conflict.

== Sacrifice

// Offers herself as a sacrifice to _a_ Great Mother, Seline, who is both too
// loving to accept the death sacrifice but not loving enough _not_ to continue
// Rumi's castration and binding by the "old Honmoon".
//
// Seline can't bring her self to touch Rumi's face.
//
// Rumi's demonic moment.

== Collapse

// Rumi had to go all the way to rock bottom before she could be reborn.

== Communion

This frame is terrifying. It has everything that repels a primate:
feline-reptilian eyes, fangs, and fingers spread to resemble the legs of our
ancient enemies the arthropods.

// Crucifixion imagery, undermining the notion of "savior". Their legs are
// crossed over just like Jesus is depicted!

// JINU IS WEARING THE BRACELET!

== Rebirth

// Gwi-ma shooting Dragon Fire at her.
//
// Rumi's fusion with her animus and acceptance of her shadow. It allows her to
// overcome Gwima, which is just another form of the Great Mother.
//
// Jinu's own hero sacrifice.

= Afterword

Writing this has been a strange experience for me.

My first contact with Kpop Demon Hunters was through its music; a fellow choir
member sang _Golden_ at a karaoke night. I somehow then stumbled upon the movie
trailer on Youtube, then perhaps the lyric videos of _Golden_, _Soda Pop_, _How
it's Done_, and _Takedown_. By then I was hooked, but wisely left a few songs
untouched, realizing that I had to watch the movie properly before an upcoming
trip to Thailand. I knew my brain wouldn't leave me alone if I didn't. A few
nights before the trip I signed up for Netflix and watched it, and it
immediately did something to my brain. I watched it again several times during
the trip, going back and forth over the songs and scenes, and the content of
this article welled up naturally. I took copious notes in a strange
preoccupation. I write these exact sentences at 3:30 in the morning, having
woken up with a realization about a clever rhyming pattern in Jinu's lyrics
within _Free_.

// TODO: Show the rhyming pattern in a footnote.
//
// It's just easy when I'm with you,
// No one sees me the way you do,
// I don't trust it, but I _wannu_,
// I keep coming back to...

I think this is my favourite movie. It matches me somehow. I sing, I live in
Asia, I've always had cats, I love archetypal stories, and I deeply appreciate
unapologetically multilingual media. And I see you, Jinu.

More than that, it feels like something of my own Honmoon has been lifted. I am
somehow more relaxed, less tense despite returning to life in the biggest city
in the world with the pressures of trying to find a place for myself. I can only
say thank you to Maggie Kang and the entire KDH team for giving this to me. Let
this article be an expression of my gratitude and love for what they created,
and an embrace of my own Anima.

Kpop Demon Hunters is the Hero's Story. It is a tale we will never stop telling.
