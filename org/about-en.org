I'm Colin Woodbury, known as Fosskers on the web. I am a professional developer
and am also active in Open Source, with a number of published applications and
libraries in [[https://crates.io/users/fosskers][Rust]] and [[https://hackage.haskell.org/user/fosskers][Haskell]]. Functional programming interests me greatly and
allows me to realize my core programming values: Rigour, Minimalism, and Beauty.

My largest public project is the [[https://github.com/fosskers/aura][Aura Package Manager]] for Arch Linux.

Otherwise, I've written code in a variety of languages, including Scala,
Purescript, Elm, Go, C, Python, Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, Fennel, and Clojure.

For specifics, please see [[/en/cv][my full CV]].

Before pursuing programming professionally, I taught English in Japan for
several years. I speak both English and Japanese, and have studied German,
Italian, and Esperanto. Apart from learning languages, I often go rock climbing
in my spare time.

This website is written in Haskell using the [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai][wai]], [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid][lucid]], and [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/org-mode][org-mode]] libraries,
and uses absolutely no Javascript.
